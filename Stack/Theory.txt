Stack Operations:-
 isEmpty() : Return true if Stack is isEmpty
 push(x) : Insert an item to the top of the Stack
 pop() : Removes an item from the top
 peek() : Returns the top item
 size() : Returns the size of the Stack

** Insertion and Deletion from the same side
** LIFO :- Last in First Out

Underflow :- when pop() and peek() called on empty Stack
Overflow :- when push called on a full Stack

# Applications of Stack:-
  1. Function Calls
  2. Balanced Parenthesis (Last Opened Bracket should close first)
  3. Reversing Items
  4. Infix to postfix/prefix
  5. Evaluation of postfix/prefix
  6. Stock Span Problem
  7. Undo/Redo or Forward/Backward
