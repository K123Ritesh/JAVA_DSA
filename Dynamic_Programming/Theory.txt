The idea is to reuse the slution of subproblem when there are overlappping subproblem.
1. Memoization(Top Down)
2. Tabulation(Bottom up)

Applications
1. Bellman ford Algorithm
2. Floyd warshall Algorithm
3. Diff utility(LCS)
4. Search Close Words(Edit Distance)
5. Resource Allocation(0 - 1 Knapsack)
